# famous-views Quick Start

This is just a fresh Meteor project implementing the
instructions from http://famous-views.meteor.com/start.

# If you need Meteor
$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh

# Download the QuickStart
$ git clone https://github.com/gadicc/fview-quickstart
$ cd fview-quickstart
$ meteor
```

Instead of `git clone` you can also just **download** the latest release (in .zip or .tar.gz) from [here](https://github.com/gadicc/fview-quickstart/releases).

## What's in the box?

* templates for javascript, coffeescript, html & jade
